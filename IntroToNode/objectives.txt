#Using Node

  * Interact with Node Console.
        --> REPL: Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop
        - this ^ is based off of using the command line
          writing server side JavaScript by just typing
          "node" on the CM.
        - You can type "irb" (Stands for: "Interactive Ruby")
          on your console and then you can type server side
          code for ruby.
  * Run a file with Node.
        - Type on the command line:
          "> node <filename>"
